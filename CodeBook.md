      
The main variables I used in functions are:
xTest - This holds the dataset X_test.txt
yTest - This holds the dataset Y_test.txt
xTrain - This holds the dataset X_train.txt
yTrain - This holds the dataset Y_train.txt
tidyDataset1 - This holds the merged dataset of xTest and xTrain

The main variables I used outside of the functions are:
theRegEx - This is the regular expression to find a particular string.
tidyData1 - This holds the first dataset.
tidyData2 - This holds the second dataset.

The names of the columns are:
activity_labels_integer - This is the assigned name of the first column of yTest and yTrain.
activity_labels - This is the assigned name of the second column of yTest and yTrain.

The rest of the columns are named in the following format:
pattern.variables...signals
